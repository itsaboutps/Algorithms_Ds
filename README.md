# Programming and Data Structures: 
Programming in modern languages viz. Java, .Net,
Open Source (PHP), Python, GoLang, NodeJS, etc. 
# Functions, Recursion, Parameter passing, Scope, Binding, Abstract data types Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Binary search trees, Binary heaps, Object Oriented Programming Concepts- Object, Class, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation.

# Algorithms: Analysis, Asymptotic, notation, Notions of space and time complexity, Worst and average case analysis, Design; Greedy approach, Dynamic programming, Divide-andconquer, Tree and graph traversals, Connected competent, Spanning trees, Shortest paths;Hashing, Sorting, Searching, Asymptotic analysis (best, worst, average cases) of time and space, upper and lower bounds, Basic concept of complexity classes â€“P, NP, NP-hard, NPcomplete
